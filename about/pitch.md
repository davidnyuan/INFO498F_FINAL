### Project 201 Pitch - David Yuan (This was the framework for the pitch I had for the presentation)

The clouded leopard became extinct in 2013. This could easily have been preventable had we been more careful with habitat destruction. This is just one example that proves that the Earth isn’t just for humans. We share it with other animals, plants, bacteria, and many other things we don’t even know about yet. However, without this synergetic relationship with other organisms, nature will cease to exist. And if that were to happen, so would we. Thus, to ensure our own survival, we need to ensure the future of nature. 

Our group focused our efforts on one such organism that may cease to exist from our world in as soon as 30 years: coral reefs. These areas contain the highest concentration of biodiversity on the planet - even more so than tropical rainforest. As such, they are a huge attraction for tourists all across the globe.

##### What is coral bleaching? visual:
So coral bleaching is a quantifiable way to measure the destruction level of a coral reef. What gives coral its color is the various accumulations of bacteria, plankton, and algae, and coral bleaching is the process where these organisms begin to die due to changes in water temperatures and pH levels. Corals receive nutrients from these organisms, and when they die out, it will slowly starve to death

##### Coral bleaching slide:
our group created an reactive visual that incorporates data from various global monitoring sites. This map shows coral bleaching across the globe. Here, we can switch the criterion to show various levels of bleaching. As you can see, heavy coral bleaching is occurring all across the globe.

##### Briefly disctuss all other visuals.

##### bleaching vs warming: 
with the data we found, we created one last visualization that shows the correlation between global temperatures and the prevalence of coral bleaching

##### Conclusion: 
A huge part of global warming is the excessive emission of CO2. When this molecule reacts with water, it forms carbonic acid, which affects the pH of water, and makes it inhabitable for many organisms. Let’s take a step back. This issue is bigger than you, its certainly bigger than me, and it’s bigger than this entire campus. this is an issue that needs to be recognized on a global level before any action can be taken. People need to be aware of what leave behind, be it a carbon footprint, wasteful use of water, or nitrogen runoff. The goal of our group is to visualize and show the effects mankind on this earth. Currently, the actions of mankind is extremely self-destructive. If things continue they way they are, it is possible within three generations from now there will be a mass extinction even that rivals that of the extinction of the dinosaurs. It is possible that our great grandkids will live in a world that is uninhabitable due to the decisions we make today.

Now, the first step to solving this problem is make sure that more people become aware of the issue.

##### Bring up Next steps and explain what we want to do in the future:
eventually we want to move forward with this project and turn it into the big picture.
