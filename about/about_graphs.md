Keep this instructions so everyone can see them.
- Summarise what your graph is telling
- Include any relevant information (time span, etc)
- Include any code used to help determine how to display the data.  For example:
	```
	data %>% group_by(x) %>% summarise(n = n() %>% filter(n > 30)
	```
	Was used to determine which diseases I should allow users to specify in my select menu
