### **Dataset Information:** 
#### The datasets used involve average global temperatures, the locations of coral reefs, coral reef bleaching, coral reef diseases, monitoring sites that include coral reefs, and marine protected areas (MPAs) that contain coral reefs.

#### This data on coral reefs was obtained from [reefbase.org](http://www.reefbase.org/global_database/default.aspx), which is the official database of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN). The data was collected by various organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), a part of the United Nations Environment Programme. The rationale behind collecting this data is help spur international efforts to protect coral reefs, which have slowly been dying out due to changes in ocean temperatures and CO2 levels within the waters.

#### The data on global warming temperatures was obtained from [Carbon Dioxide Information Analyst Center](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_PROGRAM=prog.climsite_monthly.sas&_SERVICE=default&id=212142#write_somevars_clim_mon) showing the average global temperatures in Fahrenheit and average global precipitation in inches.
