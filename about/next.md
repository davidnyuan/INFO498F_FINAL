### What Will We do now?

#### Global conservation efforts are something that need increased support from more organizations and people. Our project focused on the effects our actions have had on one specific organism: Coral reefs. This, unfortunately, is just the tip of the iceberg. Moving forward, we have ideas to: 


##### *Investigate other causes of global warming/coral bleaching besides temperature changes*

##### *Create predictive algorithms to predict where future bleaching will occur*

##### *Move onto conservation efforts for different species*
